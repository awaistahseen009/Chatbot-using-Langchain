# Chatbot powered by LangChain

🚀 Exciting News: I've built a cutting-edge Chatbot powered by LangChain, utilizing the incredible capabilities of language models like OpenAI's GPT Models, FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search), SERP API, and more! 🤖

## Introduction

In today's fast-paced world, we need technology that can not only understand language but also interact with data and documents intelligently. That's where LangChain comes in!

LangChain is a revolutionary framework for developing applications powered by language models. It empowers applications to be data-aware and agentic, connecting language models with other sources of data and enabling them to interact with their environment.

## Key Features

- **Components:** Modular abstractions for working with language models, making it easy to integrate them into your projects.
- **Off-the-shelf chains:** Pre-built assemblies of components for accomplishing specific higher-level tasks, simplifying the development process.

## Chatbot Modes

1. **Normal Mode:** Chat naturally and access web information seamlessly thanks to Google's SERP API.
2. **Document Mode:** Choose between PDF and CSV documents, upload them, generate embeddings using FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search), and then send queries to Language Models for advanced insights and interactions.

## Usage

1. Clone the project from GitHub and add API keys to the `.gitignore` file, including OpenAI and SERP API keys.
2. Run the following command in your terminal to install project dependencies:
3. Explore the different modes and functionalities of the Chatbot.

## User Interface

The user interface is as seamless as it gets, thanks to the power of Streamlit. It's designed with you in mind, ensuring a smooth and intuitive experience as you interact with this AI-driven marvel.

## Project Vision

This project is not just a demonstration of technology; it's a testament to the limitless possibilities when AI, data intelligence, and user-friendly design combine. It's a glimpse into the future of intelligent, data-driven applications.

## About Me

👨‍🎓 As a student, I took on this challenge to showcase the incredible potential of LangChain and the impact it can have on our daily lives. I believe that this project represents the fusion of AI, human creativity, and user-centric design, opening doors to new ways of problem-solving and innovation.

## Join the Journey

🙌 Join me on this journey as we explore the endless opportunities that LangChain, Streamlit, and AI-powered applications bring to the table. Let's revolutionize the way we interact with data and language, all while enjoying a seamless and engaging user experience!

🚀 Stay tuned for more updates and exciting developments. In the future, I'll be expanding this project by using Hugging Face models. 🌟
